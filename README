This folder contains the time series used in the analysis presented in the paper entitled ‘Long-Range Correlations and Memory in the Dynamics of Internet Interdomain Routing'  http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07299

The analysis in the paper is based on BGP update traces collected by the RouteViews project “http://www.routeviews.org/". Routeviews collects the BGP update data from select ASes. BGP routers in these ASes are referred to as monitors. Monitors send BGP updates to the Routeviews collector every time there is a routing change. BGP updates are recorded by the Routeviews with a granularity of one second. We focus on update traces from monitors at large transit networks in the core of the Internet. Specifically, we analyze the BGP update time series from four monitors: AT&T, NTT, IIJ, and Tinet.
AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph) is an American multinational telecommunications corporation, head- quartered in Dallas, TX. AT&T is one of the largest providers telephone services in the United States. AT&T also provides broadband subscription to television services. NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan and is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world in terms of revenue.IIJ (Internet Initiative Japan) is the first Japan’s Internet provider headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. IIJ is currently known as total solutions provider, offering network services, value-added outsourcing services, and cloud computing, WAN services and systems integration services. Tinet (The Tiscali International Network) is an Italian Internet service provider headquartered in Cagliari, Italy.  AT&T, NTT, IIJ, and Tinet monitors correspond to the largest Internet Service Providers and belong to the Default Free Zone. In other words, they have a route to every destination prefix on the Internet. Thus, corresponding BGP update traffic is a reflection of BGP dynamics taking place in the core of the Internet, where the BGP update volatility is believed to reach maximum rates. Our data spans 8.5 years from mid-2003 through the end of 2011.

The data in this folder corresponds to the time series obtained after removing session resets which is an artifact related to the measurement infrastructure (please see the paper SI for more details).

As mentioned above the folder includes the BGP updates timeseries from routers in four networks (AT&T, IIJ, NTT, Tinet). The timeseries show the number of routing updates per minute. Each file consists of two columns. The first is the minute in unix timestamp, while the second is the number of updates in that minute. 

This dataset can be used freely. Please cite the publication above if you use the data. Please do not hesitate to send an email to AHMED AT SIMULA DOT NO should you have questions about the data set.
